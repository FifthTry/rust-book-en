-- ft.h2: Variables and Mutability


We mentioned in Chapter 2 that by default, variables are *immutable*.
This is one of many nudges in Rust that encourages us to write our code in a
way that gets the most of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust has to
offer. We still have the option to make our variables mutable, though. Let's
explore how and why Rust encourages us to favor immutability, and why we might
want to opt out of that.

Variables being immutable means once a value is bound, you can't
change that value. To illustrate this, let's generate a new project in your
projects directory called `variables` by using `cargo new --bin variables`.

Then, in your new `variables` directory, open `src/main.rs` and replace its code
with the following:

Filename: src/main.rs

-- ft.code:
lang: rust,ignore

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}


-- ft.markdown:

Save and run the program using `cargo run`, and you should receive an error
message, as in this output:

-- ft.code:
lang: bash

\$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.0.1 (file:///projects/variables)
error: re-assignment of immutable variable `x` [--explain E0384]
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
4 |>     x = 6;
  |>     ^^^^^
note: prior assignment occurs here
 --> src/main.rs:2:9
2 |>     let x = 5;
  |>         ^


-- ft.markdown:

This is our first example of the compiler helping us find an error in our
program! Compiler errors can be frustrating. Keep in mind that they only mean
your program isn't safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do _not_ mean
that you're not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler
errors. The Rust compiler is trying to help your program be the very best.

The error tells us that the cause of the error is `re-assignment of immutable
variable`, because we tried to assign a second value to the immutable `x`
variable.

-- ft.markdown:

It's important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a
value that we previously said was immutable because this very situation can
lead to bugs. If one part of our code operates on an assumption that a value
will never change, and another part of our code changes that value, it's
possible that the first part of the code won't do what it was designed to do.
This cause of bugs can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially
when the second piece of code only changes the value _sometimes_.

-- ft.markdown:

In Rust, we can trust that a value we say won't change really won't change,
because the compiler is enforcing that guarantee for us. When reading and
writing code, we don't have to keep track in our head how and where a value
might change. This can make code easier to reason about.

-- ft.markdown:

Mutability can be really useful, though! Variables are immutable only by
default; you can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable
name. In addition to allowing this value to be changed, it conveys intent to
future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be
changing this value.

-- ft.markdown:

For example, change the program you just wrote to the following:

-- ft.markdown:

Filename: src/main.rs

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}


-- ft.markdown:

Running this, we get:

-- ft.code:
lang: bash

\$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6


-- ft.markdown:

Using `mut`, we are allowed to change the value that `x` binds to from `5` to
`6`. In some cases you'll want to make a variable mutable because it makes the
code easier to understand than an implementation that only uses immutable
variables. In cases where you're using large data structures, mutating an
instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated
instances. It all depends on the tradeoffs you want to make in your situation.

-- ft.h3: Shadowing


As we saw in the guessing game tutorial, we can declare new variables with the
same name as a previous variable, and the new variable *shadows* the previous
variable. We say that the first variable is *shadowed* by the second, which means
that the second variable's value is what you will see when you use the variable.
We can shadow a variable by using the same variable's name and repeating the use
of the `let` keyword as follows:

Filename: src/main.rs

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    let x = x * 2;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}


-- ft.markdown:

This program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then, it shadows `x` by
repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1` so that the value
of `x` is then `6`. The third `let` statement also shadows `x`, taking the
previous value and multiplying it by `2` to give `x` a final value of `12`. If
you run this, it will output:

-- ft.code:
lang: bash

\$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 12


-- ft.markdown:

This is different from marking a variable as `mut` because unless we use the
`let` keyword again, we'll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to
reassign to this variable. We can perform a few transformations on a value, but
have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

-- ft.markdown:

The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that, since we're
effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we can
change the type of the value, but reuse the same name. For
example, say we ask a user to show us how many spaces they want between some
text by sending us space characters, but we really want to store that as a
number:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();


-- ft.markdown:

This is allowed: the first `spaces` variable is a string type, and the second
`spaces` variable, which is a brand new variable that happens to have the same
name as the first one, is a number type. Shadowing thus saves us from having to
come up with different names like `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`; we can reuse
the simpler `spaces` name. If we try to use `mut` for this, however, like this:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust,ignore

let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len();


-- ft.markdown:

We will get a compile-time error because we are not allowed to mutate a
variable's type:

-- ft.code:
lang: bash

error: mismatched types [--explain E0308]
 -->
  |>
4 |> spaces = spaces.len();
  |>          ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected &-ptr, found usize
note: expected type `&str`
note:    found type `usize`

error: aborting due to previous error


-- ft.markdown:

Now that we've explored how variables work, let's look at some more
data types they can have.
