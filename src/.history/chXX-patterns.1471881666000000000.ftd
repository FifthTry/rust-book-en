-- ft.h1: Patterns


We've actually used patterns a few times so far: they're used in `let`
bindings, in function arguments, and in the `match` expression. Patterns have a
lot more abilities than we have demonstrated so far, so we'll cover some of the most commonly used ones in this section. Any of these abilities work in
any place where a pattern is used.

-- ft.h2: `let` statements


A basic `let` statement has this form:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

let PATTERN = EXPRESSION;


-- ft.markdown:

We've seen bindings that have names in the `PATTERN` slot: a name is just a
particularly humble form of pattern.

-- ft.h2: Multiple bindings


Let’s try a more complex pattern. Change our example program to this:

Filename: src/main.rs

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

fn main() {
    let (x, y) = (5, 6);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}


-- ft.markdown:

And run it with `cargo run`:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

\$ cargo run
   Compiling bindings v0.1.0 (file:///projects/bindings)
     Running `target/debug/bindings`
The value of x is: 5
The value of y is: 6


-- ft.markdown:

We’ve created two bindings with one `let`! Here’s our pattern:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

(x, y)


-- ft.markdown:

And here’s the value:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

(5, 6)


-- ft.markdown:

As you can see, the two line up visually, and so `let` binds `5` to `x` and `6`
to `y`. We could have used two `let` statements as well:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;
}


-- ft.markdown:

In simple cases like this, two `let`s may be clearer, but in others, creating
multiple bindings at once is nice. As we become more proficient in Rust, we’ll
figure out which style is better, but it’s mostly a judgement call.

-- ft.h2: Type annotations


Most of the time, Rust uses *type inference*, meaning that it attempts to infer
the types of your bindings rather than you having to declare them explicitly
even though Rust is a statically typed language. Occasionally, Rust won't have
enough information to infer the type of your value, and you will need to add a
type annotation in with the pattern.

Here’s what a `let` statement with a *type annotation* looks like:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x: i32 = 5;


-- ft.markdown:

We can add a colon, followed by the type name. Here’s the structure of a `let`
statement with a type annotation:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

let PATTERN: TYPE = VALUE;


-- ft.markdown:

Note that the colon and the `TYPE` go _after_ the `PATTERN`, not in the pattern
itself. As an example, here’s our more complex pattern with two bindings:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let (x, y): (i32, i32) = (5, 6);


-- ft.markdown:

Just like we match up the `VALUE` with the `PATTERN`, we match up the `TYPE`
with the `PATTERN`.

-- ft.h2: Literals & _


You can match against literals directly, and `_` acts as an any case:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x = 1;

match x {
    1 => println!("one"),
    2 => println!("two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}


-- ft.markdown:

This prints `one`.

-- ft.h1: Multiple patterns


You can match multiple patterns with `|`:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x = 1;

match x {
    1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}


-- ft.markdown:

This prints `one or two`.

-- ft.h2: ref and ref mut


Usually, when you match against a pattern, bindings are bound by value.
This means you'll end up moving the value out:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust,ignore

let name = Some(String::from("Bors"));

match name {
    Some(name) => println!("Found a name: {}", name),
    None => (),
}

\// name is moved here. This line will fail to compile:
println!("name is: {:?}", name);


-- ft.markdown:

If you'd prefer to bind `name` by reference, use the `ref` keyword:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let name = Some(String::from("Bors"));

match name {
    Some(ref name) => println!("Found a name: {}", name),
    None => (),
}

\// name is not moved here; the match only took a reference to its data rather
\// than moving it. This will work:
println!("name is: {:?}", name);


-- ft.markdown:

And for a mutable reference, `ref mut`:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let mut name = Some(String::from("Bors"));

match name {
    Some(ref mut name) => *name = String::from("Another name"),
    None => (),
}

\// name is not moved here; the match only took a reference to its data rather
\// than moving it
println!("name is: {:?}", name);


-- ft.h2: Destructuring


Patterns can be used to destructure structs and enums:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

let Point { x, y } = origin;


-- ft.markdown:

This brings an `x` and `y` binding into scope, matching the `x` and `y` of
`origin`. While it can be unusual in `let`, this is the same principle of
patterns in `match`:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };

match origin {
    Point { x, y } => { }, // x and y are bound here
}


-- ft.h2: Shadowing


As with all bindings, anything bound by a pattern will shadow bindings
outside of the binding construct:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x = Some(5);

match x {
    Some(x) => { }, // x is an i32 here, not an Option<i32>
    None => (),
}


-- ft.h2: Ignoring bindings


We discussed using `_` as a whole pattern to ignore it above, but you can
also use `_` inside of another pattern to ignore just part of it:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x = Some(5);

match x {
    Some(_) => println!("got a Some and I don't care what's inside"),
    None => (),
}


-- ft.markdown:

Or like this:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);

match numbers {
    (first, _, third, _, fifth) => println!("Some numbers: {}, {}, {}", first, third, fifth),
}


-- ft.markdown:

If you want, you can use `..` to ignore all of the parts you haven't defined:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
    z: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };

match origin {
    Point { x, .. } => { }, // y and z are ignored
}


-- ft.h2: Ranges


You can match a range of values with `...`:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x = 5;

match x {
    1 ... 5 => println!("one through five"),
    _ => println!("something else"),
}


-- ft.markdown:

Ranges are usually used with integers or `char`s:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x = 'c';

match x {
    'a' ... 'j' => println!("early ASCII letter"),
    'k' ... 'z' => println!("late ASCII letter"),
    _ => println!("something else"),
}


-- ft.h2: Guards


You can introduce match guards with `if`:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x = Some(5);

match x {
    Some(x) if x < 5 => println!("less than five: {}", x),
    Some(x) => println!("{}", x),
    None => (),
}


-- ft.markdown:

If youre using if with multiple patterns, the if applies to both sides:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let x = 4;
let y = false;

match x {
    4 | 5 if y => println!("yes"),
    _ => println!("no"),
}


-- ft.markdown:

This prints `no`, because the if applies to the whole of `4 | 5`, and not to only
the `5`. In other words, the precedence of if behaves like this:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

(4 | 5) if y => ...


-- ft.markdown:

not this:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

4 | (5 if y) => ...


-- ft.h2: Bindings


You can bind values to names with `@`:
