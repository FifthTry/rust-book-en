-- ft.h1: Common Programming Concepts


This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at
their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust,
but we’ll discuss Rust’s particular syntax and conventions concerning these
common concepts.

Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments,
and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning
them early will give you a strong core to start from.

-- ft.h3: Keywords


The Rust language has a set of *keywords* that have been reserved for use by
the language only, much like other languages do. Keep in mind that you cannot
use these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have
special meanings, and you’ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust
programs; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have
been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. You
can find a list of the keywords in Appendix A.
