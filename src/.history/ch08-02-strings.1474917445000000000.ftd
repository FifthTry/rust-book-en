-- ft.h2: Strings


We've already talked about strings a bunch in Chapter 4, but let's take a more
in-depth look at them now.

-- ft.h3: Many Kinds of Strings


Strings are a common place for new Rustaceans to get stuck. This is due to a
combination of three things: Rust's propensity for making sure to expose
possible errors, strings being a more complicated data structure than many
programmers give them credit for, and UTF-8. These things combine in a way that
can seem difficult coming from other languages.

Before we can dig into those aspects, we need to talk about what exactly we
even mean by the word 'string'. Rust actually only has one string type in the
core language itself: `&str`. We talked about these string slices in Chapter 4:
they're a reference to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored somewhere else.
String literals, for example, are stored in the binary output of the program,
and are therefore string slices.

Rust's standard library is what provides the type called `String`. This is a
growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type. When Rustaceans talk about
'strings' in Rust, they usually mean "`String` and `&str`". This chapter is
largely about `String`, and these two types are used heavily in Rust's standard
library. Both `String` and string slices are UTF-8 encoded.

Rust's standard library also includes a number of other string types, such as
`OsString`, `OsStr`, `CString`, and `CStr`. Library crates may provide even
more options for storing string data. Similarly to the `*String`/`*Str` naming,
they often provide an owned and borrowed variant, just like `String`/`&str`.
These string types may store different encodings or be represented in memory in
a different way, for example. We won't be talking about these other string
types in this chapter; see their API documentation for more about how to use
them and when each is appropriate.

-- ft.h3: Creating a New String


Let's look at how to do the same operations on `String` as we did with `Vec`,
starting with creating one. Similarly, `String` has `new`:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let s = String::new();


-- ft.markdown:

Often, we'll have some initial data that we'd like to start the string off with.
For that, there's the `to_string` method:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let data = "initial contents";

let s = data.to_string();

\// the method also works on a literal directly:
let s = "initial contents".to_string();


-- ft.markdown:

This form is equivalent to using `to_string`:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let s = String::from("Initial contents");


-- ft.markdown:

Since strings are used for so many things, there are many different generic
APIs that make sense for strings. There are a lot of options, and some of them
can feel redundant because of this, but they all have their place! In this
case, `String::from` and `.to_string` end up doing the exact same thing, so
which you choose is a matter of style. Some people use `String::from` for
literals, and `.to_string` for variable bindings. Most Rust style is pretty
uniform, but this specific question is one of the most debated.

-- ft.markdown:

Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly encoded
data in them:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let hello = "السلام عليكم";
let hello = "Dobrý den";
let hello = "Hello";
let hello = "שָׁלוֹם";
let hello = "नमस्ते";
let hello = "こんにちは";
let hello = "안녕하세요";
let hello = "你好";
let hello = "Olá";
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let hello = "Hola";


-- ft.h3: Updating a String


A `String` can be changed and can grow in size, just like a `Vec` can.

-- ft.h4: Push


We can grow a `String` by using the `push_str` method to append another
string:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");


-- ft.markdown:

`s` will contain "foobar" after these two lines.

-- ft.markdown:

The `push` method will add a `char`:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let mut s = String::from("lo");
s.push('l');


-- ft.markdown:

`s` will contain "lol" after this point.

-- ft.markdown:

We can make any `String` contain the empty string with the `clear` method:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let mut s = String::from("Noooooooooooooooooooooo!");
s.clear();


-- ft.markdown:

Now `s` will be the empty string, "".

-- ft.h4: Concatenation


Often, we'll want to combine two strings together. One way is to use the `+`
operator:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2;


-- ft.markdown:

This code will make `s3` contain "Hello, world!" There's some tricky bits here,
though, that come from the type signature of `+` for `String`. The signature
for the `add` method that the `+` operator uses looks something like this:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust,ignore

fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {


-- ft.markdown:

This isn't excatly what the actual signature is in the standard library because
`add` is defined using generics there. Here, we're just looking at what the
signature of the method would be if `add` was defined specifically for
`String`. This signature gives us the clues we need in order to understand the
tricky bits of `+`.

-- ft.markdown:

First of all, `s2` has an `&`. This is because of the `s` argument in the `add`
function: we can only add a `&str` to a `String`, we can't add two `String`s
together. Remember back in Chapter 4 when we talked about how `&String` will
coerce to `&str`: we write `&s2` so that the `String` will coerce to the proper
type, `&str`.

-- ft.markdown:

Secondly, `add` takes ownership of `self`, which we can tell because `self`
does *not* have an `&` in the signature. This means `s1` in the above example
will be moved into the `add` call and no longer be a valid binding after that.
So while `let s3 = s1 + &s2;` looks like it will copy both strings and create a
new one, this statement actually takes ownership of `s1`, appends a copy of
`s2`'s contents, then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks
like it's making a lot of copies, but isn't: the implementation is more
efficient than copying.

-- ft.markdown:

If we need to concatenate multiple strings, this behavior of `+` gets
unwieldy:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;


-- ft.markdown:

`s` will be "tic-tac-toe" at this point. With all of the `+` and `"`
characters, it gets hard to see what's going on. For more complicated string
combining, we can use the `format!` macro:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = format!("{}-{}-{}", s1, s2, s3);


-- ft.markdown:

This code will also set `s` to "tic-tac-toe". The `format!` macro works in the
same way as `println!`, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it
returns a `String` with the contents. This version is much easier to read than
all of the `+`s.

-- ft.h3: Indexing into Strings


In many other languages, accessing individual characters in a string by
referencing the characters by index is a valid and common operation. In Rust,
however, if we try to access parts of a `String` using indexing syntax, we'll
get an error. That is, this code:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust,ignore

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let h = s1[0];


-- ft.markdown:

will result in this error:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

error: the trait bound `std::string::String: std::ops::Index<_>` is not
satisfied [--explain E0277]
  |>
  |>     let h = s1[0];
  |>             ^^^^^
note: the type `std::string::String` cannot be indexed by `_`


-- ft.markdown:

The error and the note tell the story: Rust strings don't support indexing. So
the follow-up question is, why not? In order to answer that, we have to talk a
bit about how Rust stores strings in memory.

-- ft.h4: Internal Representation


A `String` is a wrapper over a `Vec<u8>`. Let's take a look at some of our
properly-encoded UTF-8 example strings from before. First, this one:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let len = "Hola".len();


-- ft.markdown:

In this case, `len` will be four, which means the `Vec` storing the string
"Hola" is four bytes long: each of these letters takes one byte when encoded in
UTF-8. What about this example, though?

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let len = "Здравствуйте".len();


-- ft.markdown:

There are two answers that potentially make sense here: the first is 12, which
is the number of letters that a person would count if we asked someone how long
this string was. The second, though, is what Rust's answer is: 24. This is the
number of bytes that it takes to encode "Здравствуйте" in UTF-8, because each
character takes two bytes of storage.

-- ft.markdown:

By the same token, imagine this invalid Rust code:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust,ignore

let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let answer = &h[0];


-- ft.markdown:

What should the value of `answer` be? Should it be `З`, the first letter? When
encoded in UTF-8, the first byte of `З` is `208`, and the second is `151`. So
should `answer` be `208`? `208` is not a valid character on its own, though.
Plus, for latin letters, this would not return the answer most people would
expect: `&"hello"[0]` would then return `104`, not `h`.

-- ft.h4: Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh my!


This leads to another point about UTF-8: there are really three relevant ways
to look at strings, from Rust's perspective: bytes, scalar values, and grapheme
clusters. If we look at the string "नमस्ते", it is ultimately stored as a `Vec`
of `u8` values that looks like this:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164, 224, 165, 135]


-- ft.markdown:

That's 18 bytes. But if we look at them as Unicode scalar values, which are
what Rust's `char` type is, those bytes look like this:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']


-- ft.markdown:

There are six `char` values here. Finally, if we look at them as grapheme
clusters, which is the closest thing to what humans would call 'letters', we'd
get this:

-- ft.code:
lang: text

["न", "म", "स्", "ते"]


-- ft.markdown:

Four elements! It turns out that even within 'grapheme cluster', there are
multiple ways of grouping things. Convinced that strings are actually really
complicated yet?

-- ft.markdown:

Another reason that indexing into a `String` to get a character is not available
is that indexing operations are expected to always be fast. This isn't possible
with a `String`, since Rust would have to walk through the contents from the
beginning to the index to determine how many valid characters there were, no
matter how we define "character".

-- ft.markdown:

All of these problems mean that Rust does not implement `[]` for `String`, so
we cannot directly do this.

-- ft.h3: Slicing Strings


However, indexing the bytes of a string is very useful, and is not expected to
be fast. While we can't use `[]` with a single number, we _can_ use `[]` with
a range to create a string slice from particular bytes:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

let hello = "Здравствуйте";

let s = &hello[0..4];


-- ft.markdown:

Here, `s` will be a `&str` that contains the first four bytes of the string.
Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was two bytes, so that means
that `s` will be "Зд".

-- ft.markdown:

What would happen if we did `&hello[0..1]`? The answer: it will panic at
runtime, in the same way that accessing an invalid index in a vector does:

-- ft.code:
lang: bash

thread 'main' panicked at 'index 0 and/or 1 in `Здравствуйте` do not lie on
character boundary', ../src/libcore/str/mod.rs:1694


-- ft.h3: Methods for Iterating Over Strings


If we do need to perform operations on individual characters, the best way to
do that is using the `chars` method. Calling `chars` on "नमस्ते" gives us the six
Rust `char` values:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

for c in "नमस्ते".chars() {
    println!("{}", c);
}


-- ft.markdown:

This code will print:

-- ft.code:
lang: bash

न
म
स
्
त
े


-- ft.markdown:

The `bytes` method returns each raw byte, which might be appropriate for your
domain, but remember that valid UTF-8 characters may be made up of more than
one byte:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

for b in "नमस्ते".bytes() {
    println!("{}", b);
}


-- ft.markdown:

This code will print the 18 bytes that make up this `String`, starting with:

-- ft.code:
lang: bash

224
164
168
224
\// ... etc


-- ft.markdown:

There are crates available to get grapheme clusters from `String`s.

-- ft.markdown:

To summarize, strings are complicated. Different programming languages make
different choices about how to present this complexity to the programmer. Rust
has chosen to attempt to make correct handling of `String` data be the default
for all Rust programs, which does mean programmers have to put more thought
into handling UTF-8 data upfront. This tradeoff exposes us to more of the
complexity of strings than we have to handle in other languages, but will
prevent us from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in
our development lifecycle.

-- ft.markdown:

Let's switch to something a bit less complex: HashMap!
