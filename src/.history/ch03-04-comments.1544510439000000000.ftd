-- ft.h2: Comments


All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but sometimes
extra explanation is warranted. In these cases, programmers leave notes, or
*comments*, in their source code that the compiler will ignore but people
reading the source code may find useful.

Here’s a simple comment:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

\// hello, world


-- ft.markdown:

In Rust, comments must start with two slashes and continue until the end of the
line. For comments that extend beyond a single line, you’ll need to include
`//` on each line, like this:

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

\// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
\// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
\// explain what’s going on.


-- ft.markdown:

Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:

-- ft.markdown:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // I’m feeling lucky today
}


-- ft.markdown:

But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on a
separate line above the code it’s annotating:

-- ft.markdown:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

-- ft.code:
lang: rust

fn main() {
    // I’m feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}


-- ft.markdown:

Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments, which we’ll
discuss in Chapter 14.
