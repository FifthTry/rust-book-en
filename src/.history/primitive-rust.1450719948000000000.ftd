-- ft.h1: Primitive Rust


We’ll start our journey with Rust by talking about the absolute basics —
concepts that appear in almost every programming language. Many programming
languages have lots in common at their core. None of the concepts presented are
unique to Rust, but we’ll cover Rust’s particular syntax and conventions around
these common concepts.

If you want to skip this section, you can, but you may end up coming back later
to find out small details. These foundations will be in every single useful
Rust program, and learning them gives us a strong core to start from.
