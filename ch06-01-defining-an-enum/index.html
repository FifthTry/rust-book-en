with structs. Let’s look at a situation we might want to express in code and
see why enums are useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say we
need to work with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP
addresses: version four and version six. Because these are the only
possibilities for an IP address that our program will come across, we can
<em>enumerate</em> all possible variants, which is where enumeration gets its name.</p>

both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data
structure appropriate, because an enum value can only be one of its variants.
Both version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP
addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling
situations that apply to any kind of IP address.</p>

listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>. These are the
variants of the enum:</p>

This is useful because now both values <code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> and <code>IpAddrKind::V6</code> are of the same type: <code>IpAddrKind</code>. We can then, for instance, define a function that takes any <code>IpAddrKind</code>:</div>

Thinking more about our IP address type, at the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP address <em>data</em>; we only know what <em>kind</em> it is.

Here it’s also easier to see another detail of how enums work: the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that constructs an instance of the enum. That is, <code>IpAddr::V4()</code> is a function call that takes a <code>String</code> argument and returns an instance of the <code>IpAddr</code> type. We automatically get this constructor function defined as a result of defining the enum.</div>

Version four type IP addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values between 0 and 255. If we wanted to store <code>V4</code> addresses as four <code>u8</code> values but still express <code>V6</code> addresses as one <code>String</code> value, we wouldn’t be able to with a struct. Enums handle this case with ease:</div>

by the standard library. The <code>Option</code> type encodes the very common scenario in
which a value could be something or it could be nothing. For example, if you
request the first of a list containing items, you would get a value. If you
request the first item of an empty list, you would get nothing. Expressing this
concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can check whether you’ve
handled all the cases you should be handling; this functionality can prevent
bugs that are extremely common in other programming languages.</p>

include, but the features you exclude are important too. Rust doesn’t have the
null feature that many other languages have. <em>Null</em> is a value that means there
is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of
two states: null or not-null.</p>

<p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first
comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My
goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with
checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the
temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to
implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system
crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in
the last forty years.</p>

In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn’t understand how to add an <code>i8</code> and an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>, because they’re different types. When we have a value of a type like <code>i8</code> in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we always have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check for null before using that value. Only when we have an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code> (or whatever type of value we’re working with) do we have to worry about possibly not having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before using the value.</div>

Generally, this helps catch one of the most common issues with null: assuming that something isn’t null when it actually is.</div>
<div data-ext-id="main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,3:main" data-id="0,0,0,1,3,1,12:main-container-external:0.inner-external:0,0,0.inner-external:0,0,0,1,3:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(10,26,31,1); font-family: apple-system; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400; line-height: 24px; padding-bottom: 8px; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md">Eliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you to be more confident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. Then, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case when the value is null. Everywhere that a value has a type that isn’t an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, you <em>can</em> safely assume that the value isn’t null. This was a deliberate design decision for Rust to limit null’s pervasiveness and increase the safety of Rust code.</div>

The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum has a large number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can check them out in <a href="../std/option/enum.Option.html">its documentation</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Becoming familiar with the methods on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> will be extremely useful in your journey with Rust.</div>

You want some code that will run only when you have a <code>Some(T)</code> value, and this code is allowed to use the inner <code>T</code>. You want some other code to run if you have a <code>None</code> value, and that code doesn’t have a <code>T</code> value available. The <code>match</code> expression is a control flow construct that does just this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on which variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching value.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><style>

    /*
        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
